# raytracer

A ray tracer written in Rust.

## Why a ray tracer?

I have always been interested in computer graphics and had always wanted to
write a ray tracer since doing my Advanced Graphics course at university, so it
seemed a natural fit when trying to find a project to learn Rust with. In
addition ray tracing produces beautiful images rather than files full of numeric
values or unexciting csv data or the like.

## Implementation

I will be working primarily from [The Ray Tracer
Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com) using Rust as my language of choice.
Since the book provides only the general algorithm and test cases it will
provide an opportunity to use some of Rust's more interesting features and its
ease of refactoring to refine the design as time goes on. While I am mostly
intending to follow the book, a ray tracer provides ample opportunity for
extension and playing around with optimisations later on.
